# tsconfig.json Documentation

The `tsconfig.json` file in a TypeScript project specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

## Purpose

This file tells the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) how to compile the TypeScript files in the project. It defines various settings that affect the compilation process, such as the target JavaScript version, modules to include, strictness levels, and how to handle JSX.

## Key Sections

### `compilerOptions`
This object contains the main compiler options.

-   `target`: Specifies the target JavaScript version for the compiled output (ES2017).
-   `lib`: Lists the built-in API libraries available to the environment (DOM, DOM iterable, and latest ECMAScript features).
-   `allowJs`: Allows JavaScript files to be compiled.
-   `skipLibCheck`: Skips type checking of declaration files (`.d.ts`).
-   `strict`: Enables a broad range of strict type-checking options.
-   `noEmit`: Prevents the compiler from emitting output files. This is common in Next.js projects as Next.js handles the compilation.
-   `esModuleInterop`: Enables compatibility between CommonJS and ES modules.
-   `module`: Specifies the module system for the generated code (esnext).
-   `moduleResolution`: Determines how module specifiers are resolved (bundler).
-   `resolveJsonModule`: Allows importing `.json` files as modules.
-   `isolatedModules`: Ensures that each file can be compiled as a separate module.
-   `jsx`: Specifies the JSX factory to use (preserve).
-   `incremental`: Enables incremental compilation for faster rebuilds.
-   `plugins`: Specifies compiler plugins to use. The `next` plugin provides Next.js specific type enhancements.
-   `paths`: Configures module path aliases. `@/*` maps to `./*`, allowing absolute imports from the project root.

### `include`
An array of glob patterns that specify which files should be included in the compilation.

-   `next-env.d.ts`: Includes the Next.js environment declaration file.
-   `**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx`: Includes all `.ts` and `.tsx` files in the project and its subdirectories.
-   `.next/types/**/*.ts`: Includes generated TypeScript types from the `.next` directory.

### `exclude`
An array of glob patterns that specify which files should be excluded from the compilation.

-   `node_modules`: Excludes the `node_modules` directory.

## Modifying the Configuration

You can adjust the `compilerOptions`, `include`, and `exclude` sections to fit the needs of your project. Refer to the official TypeScript documentation for a comprehensive list of available options.
