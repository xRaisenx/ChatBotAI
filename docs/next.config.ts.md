# next.config.ts Documentation

The `next.config.ts` file is a configuration file for Next.js, written in TypeScript. It allows you to customize various aspects of your Next.js application's build and runtime behavior with the benefits of TypeScript's type checking.

**Note:** This project also contains a `next.config.mjs` file. Typically, a Next.js project only has one configuration file. The presence of both might indicate that one is a remnant or that there's a specific reason for having both (though this is uncommon). The Next.js documentation recommends using either `.js`, `.mjs`, or `.ts`.

## Purpose

This file is used to configure settings such as:

-   Enabling React Strict Mode
-   Configuring image optimization
-   Setting up environment variables
-   Modifying webpack configuration
-   Adding custom headers, redirects, or rewrites

## Configuration Details

The current `next.config.ts` file contains a basic structure with a placeholder for configuration options.

-   `import type { NextConfig } from "next";`: Imports the `NextConfig` type for type safety.
-   `const nextConfig: NextConfig = { /* config options here */ };`: Defines the `nextConfig` object with the `NextConfig` type. The comment indicates where configuration options should be added.

## Extending the Configuration

You can add configuration options to the `nextConfig` object within the curly braces. Refer to the official Next.js documentation for a full list of available options. Since this is a TypeScript file, you will benefit from type suggestions and checking as you add configurations.
