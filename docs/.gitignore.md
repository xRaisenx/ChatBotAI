# .gitignore Documentation

The `.gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files and directories that Git should ignore. This helps keep your repository clean and prevents sensitive information or build artifacts from being committed.

## Purpose

This file is used by Git to determine which files and directories to exclude from the repository. This is essential for ignoring things like:

-   Dependency directories (`node_modules`)
-   Build outputs (`.next`, `out`, `build`)
-   Operating system specific files (`.DS_Store`)
-   Log files
-   Environment files (`.env*`)
-   Vercel specific files (`.vercel`)
-   TypeScript build info (`*.tsbuildinfo`, `next-env.d.ts`)

## How to Add or Modify Ignore Patterns

Each line in the `.gitignore` file represents a pattern.

-   Blank lines or lines starting with `#` are ignored.
-   Standard glob patterns are used.
-   A leading slash `/` ignores the pattern in the root directory only.
-   A trailing slash `/` indicates a directory.
-   An exclamation mark `!` negates a pattern, meaning files matching the pattern will *not* be ignored, even if a previous pattern would have ignored them.

**Examples from this file:**

-   `/node_modules`: Ignores the `node_modules` directory in the root.
-   `/.next/`: Ignores the `.next` directory in the root.
-   `*.log*`: Ignores any file ending with `.log` or `.log.` followed by other characters.
-   `!.yarn/patches`: Does *not* ignore the `patches` directory within `.yarn`, even though `.yarn/*` is ignored.

To add a file or directory to the ignore list, simply add a new line with the appropriate pattern to this file.
