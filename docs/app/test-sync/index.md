# app/test-sync/ Documentation

The `app/test-sync/` directory contains a page specifically designed for testing the product sync API route (`/api/sync-products`).

## Purpose

This directory provides a dedicated environment to manually trigger and test the product synchronization process. It's useful for verifying that the sync endpoint is working correctly and observing its output during development and debugging.

## Structure

This directory contains a `page.tsx` file, which defines the React component for the test page.
