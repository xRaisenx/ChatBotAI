# app/favicon.ico Documentation

The `favicon.ico` file is a small icon displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, and bookmarks.

## Purpose

It serves as the website's icon, helping users identify the site among multiple open tabs or in their bookmarks.

## Usage

Browsers automatically look for a `favicon.ico` file in the root of the website. In Next.js projects using the `app` directory, placing it in the `app/` directory makes it accessible at the root path.
