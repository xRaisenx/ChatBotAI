# app/api/ Documentation

The `app/api/` directory in a Next.js App Router project is used to define API routes. Files within this directory are treated as API endpoints rather than React pages.

## Purpose

API routes allow you to build your own API endpoints within your Next.js application. This is useful for handling form submissions, fetching data from databases, interacting with external services, or any other server-side logic that needs to be exposed as an API.

## Structure

Each subdirectory within `app/api/` typically represents a distinct API route or a group of related routes. The `route.ts` (or `.js`, `.mjs`) file within each route directory handles the HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for that route.

For example, `app/api/chat/route.ts` handles requests to the `/api/chat` endpoint.
