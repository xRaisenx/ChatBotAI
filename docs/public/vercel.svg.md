# public/vercel.svg Documentation

The `vercel.svg` file is a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file containing the logo for Vercel.

## Purpose

This file provides the official Vercel logo as a vector graphic. It's commonly used in the application's UI, particularly in the footer or "Deploy" section, to indicate that the project is hosted on or optimized for the Vercel platform.

## Usage

This logo can be used directly in HTML using an `<img>` tag or an inline `<svg>` element, or referenced in CSS. Since it's in the `public/` directory, it can be accessed at the `/vercel.svg` path in the application.
