# public/globe.svg Documentation

The `globe.svg` file is a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file containing an icon representing a globe.

## Purpose

This file provides a vector-based icon that can be used in the application's user interface to visually represent concepts related to the internet, world, or internationalization. SVG files are resolution-independent and can be scaled without losing quality.

## Usage

This icon can be used directly in HTML using an `<img>` tag or an inline `<svg>` element, or referenced in CSS. Since it's in the `public/` directory, it can be accessed at the `/globe.svg` path in the application.
