# public/next.svg Documentation

The `next.svg` file is a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file containing the logo for Next.js.

## Purpose

This file provides the official Next.js logo as a vector graphic. It's commonly used in the application's UI, particularly on the home page or in documentation, to indicate that the project is built with Next.js.

## Usage

This logo can be used directly in HTML using an `<img>` tag or an inline `<svg>` element, or referenced in CSS. Since it's in the `public/` directory, it can be accessed at the `/next.svg` path in the application.
