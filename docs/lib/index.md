# lib/ Documentation

The `lib/` directory contains utility functions and libraries used throughout the application.

## Purpose

This directory is typically used for storing code that provides core functionality or interacts with external services, but is not directly related to the user interface or API routes. This promotes code reusability and separation of concerns.

## Structure

This directory contains `.ts` files, each likely defining functions or classes related to a specific library or utility.
