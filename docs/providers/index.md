# providers/ Documentation

The `providers/` directory contains React components that provide context to the rest of the application.

## Purpose

Provider components use React's Context API to make certain data or functionality available to components deeper in the component tree without having to pass props down manually at each level. This is commonly used for themes, authentication, state management, and other global concerns.

## Structure

This directory contains `.tsx` files, each defining a React context provider component.
