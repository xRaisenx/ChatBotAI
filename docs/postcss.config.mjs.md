# postcss.config.mjs Documentation

The `postcss.config.mjs` file is the configuration file for PostCSS, a tool that uses JavaScript plugins to transform CSS. This configuration uses the ES module syntax (`.mjs`).

## Purpose

PostCSS is commonly used to process CSS files, for tasks such as:

-   Adding vendor prefixes
-   Compiling future CSS syntax
-   Linting CSS
-   Integrating with frameworks like Tailwind CSS

In this project, it's configured to integrate with Tailwind CSS.

## Configuration Details

-   `plugins`: An array of PostCSS plugins to use.
    -   `"@tailwindcss/postcss"`: This plugin integrates Tailwind CSS with PostCSS, enabling Tailwind's features and processing within the CSS build pipeline.

## Extending the Configuration

You can add more PostCSS plugins to the `plugins` array as needed. Popular plugins include `autoprefixer` (for adding vendor prefixes) and `cssnano` (for minifying CSS).
