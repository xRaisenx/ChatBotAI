# CHANGELOG.md Documentation

The `CHANGELOG.md` file documents all notable changes made to the project across different versions. It follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format, which is based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Purpose

This file serves as a human-readable history of changes, making it easy for users and contributors to understand what's new, improved, fixed, or removed in each release.

## Format

The changelog is organized by version, with the latest changes typically listed under an "Unreleased" section for changes that haven't been formally released yet. Each version or the "Unreleased" section contains the following categories:

-   `Added`: For new features.
-   `Changed`: For changes to existing functionality.
-   `Fixed`: For bug fixes.
-   `Removed`: For removed features.

## How to Add New Entries

When making changes to the project, add an entry under the appropriate category in the "Unreleased" section.

1.  Identify the type of change (Added, Changed, Fixed, or Removed).
2.  Write a concise description of the change.
3.  Add the entry as a list item (`- `) under the relevant category in the `## Unreleased` section.

When a new version is released, the "Unreleased" section is renamed to the new version number (e.g., `## [1.0.0] - YYYY-MM-DD`), and a new "Unreleased" section is created for future changes.
